# Bullet it!


## Project Purpose



# On the Fly


## Project Overview


### Website Purpose & Goals:

This website is designed as to provide users with a bullet journal inspired application for organising all aspects of their daily lives. 

### Website Planning & Design Process:

#### 1. Initial Planning 

The planning commenced with pen and paper brainstorming and some competitor website analysis. Here ideas for a twist on a regular todo app were considered. Bullet journaling is a widely used and fast trending practice of using a notebook to organise and all aspects of life at the moment. I viewed many videos along with a Ted talk by the founder of this concept and decided to explore this as a theme for my data centric project. Competitor analysis was then carried out on some todo list applications for mobile and desktop. Other mobile and desktop application interfaces were also reviewed using resources such as Pinterest and Dribble for guidance on usability.

#### 2. User Stories

From here I decided to complete some user stories before commencing wireframing. This helped me to think through the user journey and design a good site map and navigation path. All user stories have been included in a file labelled "User Story" for project review.

#### 2. Wireframe

After the initial planning stage, analog pen and paper wireframes were completed. From here I developed these wireframes further using [Balsamiq](https://www.balsamiq.com "Balsamiq Homepage"). At this point I fine tuned down my features and layout. There were some cosmetic adjustments during the development process but on a whole the original mockups were followed quite closely. All wireframes have been included in a file labelled "Wireframe" for project review.

#### 2. Databse Schema Design

Using a MongoDB, a non-relational database required a lot of forward planning and mapping out how I would go about designing my databse in a way that would work for my application model. As I planned on having multiple user functionality thought needed to be given on how to best store this data.

## Functionality and Technologies Used


### Functionality
This is a multipage application website built using Google's Materialize framework for responsive layout and navigation. There is a simple homepage enlightening the user about Bullet Journaling and its origin. There is a simple login/signup interface which may be developed in the future to include password authentication. Once you log in there is a clean navigation menu and path for users to follow to commence organising and tracking their lives. 

The main purpose of this site is to enable the user to easily record and store notes, tasks and events occurring in their daily lives in an organised way. The application is organised making use of terms native to the Bullet Journaling process such as "Collections" which is a term used to describe items that belong to the same group/cateory and "Future Log" - here a user can view what tasks or events are/have occurred on a 6 monthly basis. 

### Technologies Used

- HTML5 
- CSS3 - Along with using CSS for styling this was also used to create the side filtering menu.
- [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/ "Materialize Homepage")  - used for responsive layout, clean navigation and list layout.
- Javascript - Ajax for homepage message.
- Python 3 - used to 
- [Flask Framework](http://flask.pocoo.org/ "Flask Homepage")
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/ "MongoDB Homepage") 
- [Jquery](https://jquery.com/Jquery "Jquery Homepage") - Materialize uses Jquery for some of its navigation features e.g. accoridons and side navigation for mobile devices.
